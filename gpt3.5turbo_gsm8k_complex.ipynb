      "Question: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total.\n",
      "For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.\n",
      "Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.\n",
      "However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.\n",
      "They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.\n",
      "And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.\n",
      "So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.\n",
      "They want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75\n",

      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= 50 points in 2 pointers.\n",
      "His team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8*3= 24 points in 3 pointers\n",
      "They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10*1=10 points in free throws.\n",
      "All together his team scored 50+24+10= 84 points\n",
      "Mark's opponents scored double his team's number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 50*2=100 points in 2 pointers.\n",

      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = 24\n",
      "The total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = 84\n",

      "The total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = 42\n",

How much profit did he make in total, in dollars?\n",

What percent of the population of the school do not like to play basketball if the ratio of the male to female students is 3:2 and there are 1000 students?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",

      "Each part represents 1000/5 = 200 students.\n",
      "So, there are 3 x 200 = 600 males.\n",
